## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

When a patient is unable to self-report their pain, there is a much greater chance that they will be given the incorrect diagnosis. This can result in the use of inappropriate, ineffective, or insufficient treatment and management tactics, all of which can lead to poor patient outcomes ranging from discomfort to greater risk of infection, circulatory disorders, compromised immune system, or even death. To resolve this issue, our product will provide health care professionals with a mobile application which can perform reliable and accurate patient pain assessments using machine learning and computer vision.

The key deliverables of this product are:
‚Ä¢ A simple, user-friendly application which can utilise the built-in camera on a smart phone to record the face/body language of a patient.
‚Ä¢ This visual data will be passed to a cloud-based assessment engine which can analyse the data using a computer vision model to evaluate a patient‚Äôs level of discomfort.
‚Ä¢ If the output of the model is higher than a specific threshold the application will send an alert to the carer/medical practitioner.
‚Ä¢ A dashboard inside the application will provide an overview to visually track recent assessments and the patient‚Äôs condition over time.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
git clone https://github.com/Gopher-Industries/Team-Justice-League
```
### Prerequisites

The project requires Android studio for application to run.

For backend service, follow steps in the next section to get started.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
The backend module contains the service for predicting Pain intensity, hosted on GCP (can run on any FLASK server).

For pipeline (T3-2022) with all the models, face recognition and face quality block:
```
cd Team-Justice-League/Server/PainSource/BackendPipeline
conda create -n <env-name> python=3.8
conda activate <env-name>
python app.py
```

For pipeline (T2-2022) with model from https://github.com/TaatiTeam/pain_detection_demo wrapped in a FLASK application:

```
cd Team-Justice-League/Server/PainSource/PainAssessmentSource/
conda create -n <env-name> python=3.8
conda activate <env-name>
python app.py
```
The server will exit once you exit your instance shell/Server, to run in background use <nohup> or simply do:

```
python app.py &
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

To test your server copy your GCP instance public IP

```
http://<GCP-IP>:5000/test
```

### Break down into end to end tests
